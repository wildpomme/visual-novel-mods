# The Shell Part 1: Inferno Uncensored Mod
A mod that adds Oneline's uncensored CGs to any version of The Shell Part 1: Inferno. Also includes an uncensored version of the opening movie.

## <b><ins>Description</ins></b>
This mod works regardless of whether you have the Johren, Jast, MangaGamer, Kagura, or Steam versions. However, if you have the Steam version, you must have the adult patch already installed.

## <b><ins>Installation</ins></b>

1. Unzip the patch and open the extracted folder.
2. Open the game's base directory (depends on where you bought the game and how you installed it).
3. Copy the TheShell.pfs.050 file and paste it in the game's base directory.
4. Copy the op1.dat file and paste it into the movie folder inside the game's base directory, overwriting the file that was already there.
5. Launch the game and enjoy!
