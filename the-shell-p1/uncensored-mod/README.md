# The Shell Part 1: Inferno Uncensored Mod
A mod that adds Oneline's uncensored CGs to any version of The Shell Part 1: Inferno. Also includes an uncensored version of the opening movie.

2. Open the game's base directory (depends on where you bought the game and how you installed it).
3. Drag and drop the TheShell.pfs.050 file and the movie folder into the game's base directory.
4. Say yes to overwriting the op1.dat file.
5. Launch the game and enjoy!
