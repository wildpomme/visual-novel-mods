# LACKGIRL P1 Textbox Opacity Mod
A mod that overwrites the textbox images to increase contrast between the text and the background. There are two provided opaqueness options. Choose the one that looks best for you.

## <b><ins>Description</ins></b>

### DISCLAIMER
There is a bug with the game where the textbox transparency is set to 0 after a screen transition, meaning the game does not honor the textbox transparency setting. By keeping the textbox transparency to 0, the textbox will always look the same instead of resetting itself constantly.

I suggest you just play at textbox transparency set to 0 and choose the version of the mod that looks best to you based on the example screenshots.

There are two versions of the mod. Only choose one: more opaque or maximum opaque. The patch permanently updates the images that the textbox uses. If you want to revert back to the original textbox, please verify your game's files in Steam.

### Original
This is what the textbox looks like by default, before patching the game.

### Maximum Opaque

3. Choose which version of the patch you want: more opaque or maximum opaque.
4. Copy the corresponding lackgirl_i.tpatch file and paste it in the game's base directory.
