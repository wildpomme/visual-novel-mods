# visual-novel-mods
This is mainly a place for mods I've created for myself to improve the readability of visual novels I've personally had trouble with. I'm sure other people would also find these useful, which is why I'm sharing them here. I'm also including other visual novel mods here that I've made as well.


## LACKGIRL Part 1
- Textbox Opacity Mod

## White Album
- Clean Textbox Mod

## The Shell Part 1: Inferno
